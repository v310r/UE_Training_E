For this homework I've implemented door and lock mechanics using blueprints and C++. Got myself familiar with collisions and interactions between Actors.

The blueprints are located in All/Content/StarterContent/Blueprints (BP_MyDoor and BP_MyLock; BP_MyWrittenDoor and BP_MyWrittenLock).

C++ files are located in Source\DoorExample\Private\<MyLessonActor>.cpp and Source\DoorExample\Private\<MyLessonActor>.h

Working map is FirstPersonExampleMap.
